## About those repos
Since I learned github properly I try to apply knowledge so that it becomes my second nature. </br> 
Trying out github and different languages/frameworks in simple mini-projects I upload daily to not forget things and in generel make it more automatic. </br>
So that I dont need to check everything in the documentation every time I want to do something. </br>
Dont mind those repos, its just my notes and future reference, I might make them private at some point </br>
